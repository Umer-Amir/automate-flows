# 📱 Personal Automate Flows

Welcome to my collection of **LlamaLab Automate** flows! These are custom automation scripts I’ve created for my personal use on Android devices — handling everything from daily routines to smart device control and system tweaks.

## 🔧 About

Each flow in this repo is designed with **personal productivity** and **convenience** in mind. While they were made to suit my own needs, they’re freely available for **anyone to explore, use, and improve**.

I believe automation should be shared — if any of these flows help you or spark new ideas, feel free to fork, tweak, or contribute!

## 🧠 What's Inside

- `.flo` files (Automate flow exports)
- Optional `.json` versions (if you want to peek inside)
- Descriptions for each flow in the corresponding folder or file

## 🛠 Requirements

- Android phone or emulator
- [Automate by LlamaLab](https://llamalab.com/automate/) (free on Play Store)

## 📤 How to Use

1. Download the `.flo` file(s) of your choice.
2. Open the **Automate** app on your Android device.
3. Tap the **menu → Import** and select the file.
4. Run, review, and modify as needed!

## 🤝 Contributing

Have improvements? New ideas? Found bugs? PRs and suggestions are welcome — just please keep things modular and well-documented.

## 📜 License

Feel free to use and remix these flows — no attribution required, but always appreciated.

Happy automating! 🚀
